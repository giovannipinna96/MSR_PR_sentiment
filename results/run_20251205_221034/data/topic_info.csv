Need to look at the explanation given by copilot for why that test failed and then make the necessary changes so the build tests all work.', ""> I don't think this approach is OK. Every next scope would override whatever was there in the [CODE]. Therefore there would be only one last observation available downstream for the service method. So, that info would be misleading and dangerous. My proposal was just [CODE] every record here to finish their traces.

Don't know if i understood everything correctly, but did all the changes that i thought were pertinent!"", '> ❓ I don\'t fully understand why we need all this. What\'s the point of having these annotations when we already tackle this with the search client proxy? The client proxy felt like a nice isolated and generic solution, whereas this relies people knowing they need to add/remove annotations. And honestly, I will have forgotten to do this by the time I implement my next endpoint 😄 That\'s a good point to raise. The idea of the search client proxy was more about having a ""catch-all"" fallback which protects against search logic slipping through. Having the [CODE] + Interceptor gives us a declarative way to mark which controller/endpoint are not supported (could be a helpful code-doc), and especially return the error early before the controller logic or downstream service code gets executed (for example validate process exists, parse/validate params, fetch primary storage data...). I agree with you that people will not always know when to add these but having both the annotation and client proxy should give us enough coverage. It will take time to initially label all these endpoints but we only do it once 😅']"
