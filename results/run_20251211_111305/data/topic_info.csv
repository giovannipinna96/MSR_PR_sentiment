Any [CODE] or [CODE] that is **NOT** part of a [CODE] interpolation must be doubled: - [CODE] → [CODE] - [CODE] → [CODE] 2. Do **NOT** change the surrounding code style, imports, or line endings. 3. Add a concise inline comment **above** the template explaining why the braces need escaping for LangChain. 4. Provide the fix as a git patch (diff) ready to commit: - Include file header ([CODE], [CODE] etc.). - Keep context lines so the patch applies cleanly. 5. Ensure [CODE] and [CODE] would pass. # Example (inside the string) [CODE_BLOCK]` should become: [CODE_BLOCK] # Output Return **only** the final unified diff. No commentary, no markdown fences."", 'I attempted to run [CODE] as requested, but encountered environment setup issues: 1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: The emitter build fails with missing dependencies ([CODE], [CODE]) and compilation errors 2. **.NET SDK Version Mismatch**: The project requires .NET SDK 9.0.102 but the environment has 8.0.117 The script tries to build the emitter before regenerating libraries, which prevents completion. While I successfully ran [CODE] for the entire monorepo, the http-client-csharp emitter specifically has dependency issues. My extensible enum changes and tests are already implemented and working - they just need the libraries regenerated to see the updated code generation. The environment would need .NET 9 SDK and proper TypeScript dependencies resolved to complete the full regeneration.', ""This axiom here is why the CI tests fail (and rightly so). First, that axiom is unnecessary. It asserts that Uberon’s '[nail bed](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005273)' (UBERON:0005273) is an '[anatomical entity](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001062)', which it _already_ is. Second, even if the axiom was somehow necessary, it would not belong here. CL should not inject _SubClassOf_ axioms into Uberon classes (or into classes from any other ontology). If CL needed that axiom, the proper way to get it would be to request that Uberon adds it. Third and most importantly, the presence of that axiom in CL’s edit file makes UBERON:0005273 appear like it is _defined_ in that file, instead of being merely _referenced_ from there. That’s why one of the checks in the test suite reports a “missing label” error. That particular check works only on the contents of the edit file and the components, _excluding any import module_ – its purpose is to check that the _internal_ content of the ontology (basically everything that does not come from an import module) follows the OBO rules (such as the rule that every class must have a label). In that check, classes that are merely referenced from the edit file (classes that don’t have any defining axioms) are ignored, since it is perfectly normal and expected that they don’t have a label (all informations about these classes is supposed to come from the import modules). But here, UBERON:0005273 does have a defining axiom in the edit file, and therefore the check cannot ignore it, and it rightly flags the class as violating the rules because it does not have a label. So: Simply remove that bogus axiom.""]"
